RESLIFE PROJECT
The Residential Life department at Valparaiso University requires students in dormitories to register overnight guests online. 
Currently, this is done through Google Forms and using email to notify roommates and residential life staff, which is then manually reviewed. 
Guided by the Residential Life Director, a specialized website that can automate and help reduce the length of this process was developed. 
Students can log in to the site to register a guest through the websiteâ€™s form. Senior and student staff can access a part of the site to see the registered 
guests in their respective buildings under their oversight. The website sends email notifications to roommates when applicable after a form is successfully submitted. 
It is created with HTML/CSS for the interface and uses basic Javascript and PHP for functionality and its database.
