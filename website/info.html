<h2>Residential Life Overnight Guest Registration Form</h2>

<p style="align:center">Students may host overnight guests within the following guidelines:</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>-All students wishing to host an approved overnight guest in their

    <br>
  <li>-Students may host no more than one guest per bed in the applicable room.
    The total number of guests per applicable room may not exceed one guest per bed.
    Example: a room has two beds, there may be no more than a total of two overnight
    guests hosted in that room. </li>
    <br>
  <li>-Each overnight guest is limited to no more than three (3)
     consecutive nights in a host’s residence hall.</li>
     <br>
  <li>-Each overnight guest may not spend
    more than five (5) nights per semester in a host’s residence hall.</li>
    <br>
  <li>-Hosts must escort their guest(s) to the appropriate bathroom and shower
    facilities during their visit. Due to safety and security concerns,
    guest(s) are not to be left unattended within the residence hall. </li>
    <br>
  <li>-Roommates have the right to a safe and healthy living environment.
    They have the right to sleep and study without being disturbed in their room.
    The roommates rights to a safe and healthy living environment supersede the
    privilege of the host having a guest visit the space.
    As such, hosts and guests are not to violate these roommate rights.
    If this occurs, the guest(s) may be asked to leave the space immediately.</li>
<br>
  <li>-All guests and hosts are expected to abide by the terms of the
    Guest and Escort policy.</li>
    <br>

    guest privileges and appropriate judicial action may be taken against the guest and/or hosts.</li>
    <br>
  <li>-Overnight guests must be Up To Date with vaccines. Up To Date with vaccines is defined as a person who has received a booster
    shot 6 months after receiving the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine series, or 2 months after a J&J vaccine. A person who has not yet reached
    the time between initial shot and booster is also defined as Up To Date (less than 6 months
    for Pfizer and Moderna or less than 2 months for J&J).</li>
    <br>
  <li>-First-Year students are not permitted to host any overnight guests (guests in a room past 1 AM)
     during the first four (4) weeks of the Fall semester. After the first four (4) weeks,
